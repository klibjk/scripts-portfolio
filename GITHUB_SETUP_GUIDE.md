# GitHub Setup Guide for Script Portfolio

Your Script Portfolio is ready to be uploaded to GitHub! Here's how to create your repository and push all the code.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right â†’ "New repository"
3. Repository name: `script-portfolio`
4. Description: `Professional Script Portfolio showcasing system administration and automation scripts`
5. Make it **Public** (to showcase your skills)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Upload Your Files

GitHub will show you an empty repository with instructions. Choose **Option 2: "or push an existing repository from the command line"**

Copy these commands and run them in your project terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/script-portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Script Portfolio with 8 professional scripts"
git push -u origin main
```

- âœ… Professional README.md with portfolio overview
- âœ… 8 complete scripts (4 categories Ã— 2 platforms each)
- âœ… Full web application with interactive script viewer

## Making It Stand Out
